          <p>In today's rapidly evolving world, innovation has become the cornerstone of progress. To tackle the challenges of the future, I believe that we must equip our students with the skills that go beyond memorization and exams. The ability to tinker and experiment will enable our children to break barriers, discover new possibilities, and create solutions that can transform our society for the better.</p>

          <p>Tinkering is not just about playing with tools; it is about exploring, learning, and growing. Tinkering instills a sense of confidence and encourages children to embrace failure as a stepping stone to success. Through trial and error, they learn perseverance and the value of hard work. This mindset of resilience is crucial as they embark on their journey of learning and discovery.</p>

          <p>The Initiative by the Government of India - the Atal Tinkering Lab under the aegis of NITI AAYOG, was established with the vision of fostering a spirit of curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving among our young minds. It is a place where innovation takes flight, where ideas are nurtured, and where dreams turn into reality. The Atal Tinkering Lab serves as a hub for collaborative learning. It brings students together and fosters a diverse and inclusive environment where ideas are shared freely, and teamwork thrives. It promotes innovative thinking which transcends disciplines and boundaries. Whether it be science, technology, arts, or social sciences, innovative thinking can revolutionize the way we approach problems.</p>

          <p>I wish the team well and hope all their endeavours enhance the learning curve. Continue thinking and tinkering and fan the tiny sparks of possibilities into flames of achievement!!!</p>
